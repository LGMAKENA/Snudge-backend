## Problem and Solution

The current student learning environment encounters difficulties in accessing and managing study materials. Students often face challenges in locating, organizing, and utilizing educational resources such as videos, audios, and articles. This leads to inefficiencies in their study routines. Additionally, the absence of a centralized digital platform hampers seamless access and communication between students, administrators, and staff members, hindering the learning process.
